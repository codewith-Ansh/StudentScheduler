# Intelligent Timetable Scheduler

A sophisticated web application that generates conflict-free timetables using **Graph Coloring** algorithms and **Discrete Mathematics** principles. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## üéØ Features

### Multiple Scheduling Types
- **Academic Courses**: Full semester timetables with theory and lab sessions
- **Examinations**: Exam scheduling with no conflicts
- **Sports Events**: Practice sessions and tournaments
- **Cultural Events**: Event planning and venue allocation

### Graph Theory Implementation
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically identifies resource and faculty conflicts
- **Graph Coloring**: Uses Welsh-Powell algorithm for optimal slot assignment
- **Visual Representation**: Interactive conflict graphs showing course relationships
- **Set Theory**: Demonstrates intersection of faculty and student sets

### Visualization & Animation
- **Conflict Graph View**: Interactive, colorful visualization of course conflicts
- **Timetable Grid View**: Standard calendar-style schedule display
- **Algorithm Steps**: Step-by-step animation showing how the algorithm works
- **Real-time Generation**: Instant schedule creation with detailed reasoning

## üí° How It Works

### Graph Coloring Approach

1. **Model as Graph**
   - Courses/Events = Vertices (Nodes)
   - Conflicts = Edges
   - Time Slots = Colors

2. **Detect Conflicts**
   - Shared faculty between courses
   - Student group overlaps
   - Resource constraints (labs, venues)

3. **Apply Welsh-Powell Algorithm**
   - Sort by degree (conflict count)
   - Assign first available color (time slot)
   - Ensure adjacent nodes have different colors

4. **Generate Schedule**
   - Labs placed first (need 2 consecutive hours)
   - Theory hours assigned by priority
   - Verify no conflicts exist

### Set Theory Foundation

```
If Faculty(Course A) ‚à© Faculty(Course B) ‚â† ‚àÖ
Then: Course A and Course B conflict
Result: Must be scheduled at different times
```

## üìä Demo Data Included

The application comes with pre-loaded demo datasets:

**Academic Courses:**
- Discrete Mathematics (4h theory + 2h lab)
- Data Structures (3h theory + 2h lab)
- Database Systems (3h theory + 4h lab)
- Computer Networks (2h theory + 2h lab)
- Software Engineering (4h theory)

**Other Schedule Types:**
- Exam schedules
- Sports practice sessions
- Cultural events

## üé® Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Algorithm**: Welsh-Powell graph coloring
- **State Management**: React hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## üî¨ Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤) where n = number of courses
- **Space Complexity**: O(n √ó d √ó h) where d = days, h = hours per day
- **Graph Construction**: O(n¬≤) for conflict detection
- **Coloring**: O(n √ó c) where c = chromatic number

## üìù Key Constraints Handled

- Faculty availability conflicts
- Lab sessions requiring 2 consecutive hours
- Priority-based scheduling
- Multiple divisions/sections
- Different lab types (combined/per-batch)
- Resource allocation (rooms, equipment)
